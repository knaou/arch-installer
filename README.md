Arch Installer
=====================

This project provides a bash script for installing Arch Linux (https://www.archlinux.org/) with GPT/UEFI/GRUB.

## Description

I wrote this script to install arch-linux on Hyper-V(Windows 10 pro).
I expected 2st generation of virtual machine, so I set up with GPT/UEFI/GRUB.
Perhaps, this completely works on other environment (e.g. physical machine or other virtual environment)

## Usage
First, boot arch linux instruction shell on your (virtual) machine. Next, run a script provided by this project.

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knaou/arch-installer/master/arch-installer.bash
    vim arch-installer.bash
    bash arch-installer.bash
